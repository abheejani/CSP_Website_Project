11th Grade - 2019-2020

In School: AP Computer Science Principles (learning the fundamentals of technology and programming)
After School: Code Club - Executive Board position,  Math Honors Society (Mu Alpha Theta), Future Business Leaders of America (FLBA)
Events: HackJA Hackathon, Hour of Code
HackJA - At the hackathon events, participated in competitions for making the best pieces of code in different categories. 
Project included coding on hardware to make video games and making text based games through Java
Hour of Code - Organizing committee. The event showcases different coding events presented by students where others can  learn more about coding and computer science in general. 

Volunteer: East Brunswick Public Library (TAG), East Brunswick Youth Council, Math Honors Society, Indian Cultural Society.  These experiences have allowed me to help others and work in a team that it aimed towards a larger objective of bettering our community. 

10th Grade - 2017-2019

In School:  AP Computer Science A. One year course where I became proficient in Java and first gained an interest in Computer Science.  
Game Design was a course where I learned to make video games online with HTML and JavaScript. 
After school: Chess, Psychology, and Code Club

IOT Summer Program at New York University: 
Learned hardware coding in C with feather huzzah ESP8266 as the microcontroller
Hour of Code was an annual by the Code Club with stations all relating to technology. 
Events: HackJA hackathon event which was a student run coding event where learned about ethical hacking and competed in coding competitions
Volunteer: East Brunswick Youth Council  included events throughout East Brunswick where I had the privilege to make my community better

Awards/Accomplishments: Completion of the Internet of Things course at New York University. From this, I gained experience in college as a whole through the immersive experience and about IOT as a career choice. 

Leadership projects/experience: Tutoring children at after school math help and in Mu Alpha Theta. Running an event and supervising other events at the annual Hour of Code Event at the East Brunswick Public Library
Lead marketing for a coding event at the public library. This leadership opportunity taught me to interact with others and communicate with them to complete projects.  The event brought 100s of community kids to the event where they can learn about coding. It required out of the box thinking in marketing through Social Media, School Library, notice board, fliers and reaching other club leads. In addition, I also reached out to the 3 other public schools in the districts via social media and schoolâ€™s support.
